# Contact Agenda - Terminal Application

This project aims to create a contact agenda application that can be operated via the terminal. The agenda offers essential contact management features, including search, insertion, updating, and deletion.

## Requirements and Features

1. **Basic Operations**:
   - Implement functionality to:
     - **Search** for a contact.
     - **Insert** a new contact.
     - **Update** an existing contact.
     - **Delete** a contact.
   - Each contact should have:
     - A **name**
     - A **phone number**

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The program will first prompt the user to choose an operation.
   - It will then ask for the required information to complete the selected action.

3. **Phone Number Validation**:
   - The application will enforce validation rules to ensure:
     - Only numeric phone numbers are allowed.
     - Phone numbers must not exceed 9 digits (or another specified limit).

4. **Program Termination**:
   - A dedicated option should allow the user to exit the program gracefully.
